## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze the tipping patterns in NYC taxi rides. By exploring various factors like trip distance, day of the week, and payment type, we aim to gain insights into what influences tip amounts and provide actionable recommendations for drivers and service providers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about NYC taxi trips, including:
- **Trip details**: `tpep_pickup_datetime`, `tpep_dropoff_datetime`, `trip_distance`
- **Passenger details**: `passenger_count`
- **Location details**: `PULocationID`, `DOLocationID`
- **Payment details**: `payment_type`, `fare_amount`, `extra`, `MTA_tax`, `tip_amount`, `tolls_amount`, `total_amount`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NYC_Taxi_Tip_Analysis.git
   cd NYC_Taxi_Tip_Analysis
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:
- Loading the dataset
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types
- Feature engineering (e.g., extracting the day of the week from datetime)
- Saving the cleaned dataset for further analysis

## Analysis

### Univariate Analysis

We explore the distribution of individual variables, such as:
- Distribution of `tip_amount`
- Summary statistics of `tip_amount`
- Distribution of `trip_distance`

### Bivariate Analysis

We analyze the relationship between two variables, such as:
- `tip_amount` vs. `day_of_week`
- `tip_amount` vs. `payment_type`
- `trip_distance` vs. `tip_amount`

## Visualization

We use various visualizations to illustrate our findings:
- Histograms
- Bar plots
- Line plots
- Box plots

### Example: Average Tip Amounts by Payment Type

```python
# Calculate the mean tip amount for each payment type
mean_tips_by_payment_type = df_filtered.groupby('payment_type')['tip_amount'].mean().reset_index()

# Convert payment type to categorical for better plotting
mean_tips_by_payment_type['payment_type'] = mean_tips_by_payment_type['payment_type'].astype(str)

# Plot the bar graph
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x='payment_type', y='tip_amount', data=mean_tips_by_payment_type, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Average Tip Amounts by Payment Type')
plt.xlabel('Payment Type')
plt.ylabel('Average Tip Amount')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, we identified key factors that influence tipping behavior in NYC taxis. These insights can help taxi drivers optimize their service and potentially increase their tips.
